"""
generate_plant_recommendation snippet

Generates a personalized care recommendation for a given plant based on its watering needs,
sunlight exposure, growth stage, and soil type. Designed to produce engaging, human-readable
guidance using a mix of structured data and playful phrasing.

Parameters:
-----------
- plant_name (str): The name of the plant to personalize the recommendation for.
- watering_level (str): One of "frequent", "average", "minimum", "unknown", or None.
- watering_frequency (str): A text formed by a range of numbers mentioning watering frequency (e.g., "7-10" or in some cases None).
- sunlight_level (str, optional): Describes light preference (e.g., "full sun", "shade"). If a plant has more than one light preference (according to perenual.com) default message is triggered.
- growth_stage (str, optional): One of "seed", "juvenile", "adult", "flowering", "fruiting", "senescence".
- soil_type (str, optional): One of "clay", "sand", "loam", "peat", "chalk", "silt".

Returns:
--------
- str: A randomly selected care recommendation string combining all inputs into a cohesive,
  friendly, and sometimes humorous message.

Behavior:
---------
- Pulls phrases from predefined banks for watering, sunlight, soil, and growth stage.
- Falls back to default messages if any input is missing or unrecognized.
- Randomly selects from multiple template formats to keep output varied and engaging.

Example:
--------
>> generate_plant_recommendation("sea lavender", "minimum", "10", "full sun", "flowering", "sand")
"Sea Lavender thrives in full sun, give it a front-row seat to the sky show. Give it low-maintenance (every 10 days), a splash now and then will do. 
Lavender is flowering with flair. Pollinators are welcome and admiration is encouraged. Sandy soil drains fast, so keep the hydration coming."

Notes:
------
- This function is designed for conversational interfaces and garden apps.
- Output is randomized for variety; repeated calls may yield different phrasing.
