Pruning should be done back to the crown of the plant, leaving no more than 3 to 5 inches of the flower stalk. This allows the plant to spend its energy on new growth and flowers instead of flowering on the previous year\u2019s stems. Deadheading the spent flowers can also promote more blooms. However, be mindful not to accidentally cut back the new growth, as it is needed for new blooms. After pruning, be sure to fertilize and water the plant. Pruning swamp milkweed helps to promote better airflow and reduces the potential for disease. Pruning should take place throughout the growing season, as needed."

Pruning should be done when the plant is actively growing (usually from early spring through mid-summer). For most plants, pruning should be done to remove any dead, diseased, or damaged stems and branches. Pruning can also be used to reduce the overall size of the plant, and to encourage new, fresh growth. It is recommended to prune no more than 1/3 of the overall plant at any 1 time. Doing so can help to maintain the health of the plant and prevent it from becoming too lanky and unruly."

            "description": "Beets (Beta vulgaris) should be watered regularly to keep the soil moist but not overly saturated. The amount of water and frequency of watering will depend on several factors such as the season, soil type, climate, and how quickly the soil becomes dry. In general, it is best to check the soil\u2019s moisture level before watering and water only when the top inch of soil is dry. In hot weather, it may be necessary to water beets every few days. In cooler weather, they may need watering only once a week. The amount of water to use should also depend on the soil type. Sandy soils generally require less water than clay soils, which hold moisture better. During summer, it may be necessary to water beets more frequently, using 1-2 inches of water per week."

Full sun locations that receive at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight on a daily basis are ideal for growing this plant species. The most favorable periods for receiving this amount of sunlight are between 11am and 4pm during summer months. Avoiding extreme heat during the middle of the day is best. For the winter months, it's recommended that the plant receive at least 5 hours of direct sunlight in a day. Temperatures that drop below 50\u00b0F can cause stunting of beet root growth, so be sure to bring beet plants indoors or give them frost-protection if necessary."

During continuous harvesting, begin removing the outer leaves of the plant when they reach an inch or 2 in length, removing no more than half of the outer leaves. When harvesting beets for storage, prune the plant only after it has reached maturity, trimming off all leaves including the healthiest looking ones. This will help protect the beets from disease and promote healthy root development."

This will ensure that the tree is shaped and growing correctly, and help with any future conflicts with other plants. Start by removing any dead, diseased, or damaged branches. After that, decide which limbs to remove depending on the desired shape of the tree. Be careful not to over prune, as the Golden Rain Tree grows back quickly if you prune too much. Remove no more than a third of the branches each time, and take care not to cut off any buds or flowers. In addition, it's important to prune the limbs so that the overall shape of the tree remains intact. Lastly, once you have finished pruning, make sure to clean up the dead branches and debris from the ground."
